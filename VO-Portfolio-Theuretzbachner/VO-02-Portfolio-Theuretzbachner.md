IoT architecture in respect to:

**Cloud:**\
Stack that allows back-end components to communicate with each other in
order to support Big Data analytics, certain interfaces and device
management; more efficient, also more cost efficient; centralized
computing\
Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Watson

**Edge:**\
distributed computing; data is processed where it was generated, meaning
the periphery of the network as close to the originating source, which
is preferable if real time relevancy is a priority, because it is
faster; issues of latency and bandwidth

alternative names: router, gateway

**Fog:\
**"mix" of cloud and edge, direct connection between edge devices and
the cloud / the internet; name stems from reference to the expression of
"cloud" both consist of water particles, except fog is more permeable,
while a cloud is more dense

**Research on Onewire**

-   aka "1-Wire", is a communication bus system

-   made by Maxim (formerly Dallas Semiconductor Corporation)

-   low-speed data with 16.3 kbps

-   single contact, easy to use, not very complex

-   very energy-efficient and cost-efficient

-   everything derives power from signal bus (parasite mode)

-   only one master needed to control slaves

    -   1-Wire busmaster

    -   connected to sensors busmaster connects to first actor, that one
        connects to the next, etc. (multidrop, supports multiple devices
        on single line)

    -   server controls busmaster via driver and communicates with the
        sensors

    -   all software runs on server

-   master sends impulses under 15ms equals 1, over 15ms equals 0

-   **Example:** Raspberry Pi: 1-Wire Temperatursensor DS1820

**RS232**

-   standard for serial communication

-   connects two devices

-   connection between terminal and modem

-   has been replaced by now

-   lower transmission speed, short maximum cable length, large voltage
    swing, large standard connectors, no multipoint capability and
    limited multidrop capability

**RS485**

-   industrial standard for asynchronous serial communication

-   used in automation and industry

-   half-duplex

-   high-speed

-   max. distance 1200 meters

**IÂ²C**

-   serial databus

-   developed by Phillips

-   five speed levels

-   10-400 kbps

-   short-distance

-   master-slave relationship

-   slaves have fixed address

-   low-active

**SPI**

-   serial peripheral interface

-   developed by Motorola

-   "loose" standard for synchronous serial data bus

-   ![](media/image2.png){width="3.4375in"
    height="1.0763888888888888in"}data communication between micro
    controller

-   settings variable: clock edge, word length

-   short distance (1-10 meters)

-   clock frequency up to MHz-range, also variable
